📌 README for Library Management System
1. Introduction
Project Information
Name: Ainembabazi Eunice
Student ID: 25881
Specialization: Programming
Database: Oracle PDB (thurs_25881_PDB_assII)
2. Problem Statement
Managing a library manually can lead to issues like book loss, tracking difficulties, and borrower mismanagement. This project aims to design a Library Management System that efficiently handles:

Authors – Stores author details.
Books – Manages book details and availability.
Borrowers – Keeps track of registered borrowers.
BorrowedBooks – Records book borrowing details.
📌 3. Database Schema
The database consists of four related tables:

Authors: Stores author information (ID, Name, Country).
Books: Contains book details (ID, Title, Genre, Author ID as FK).
Borrowers: Stores borrower details (ID, Name, Email).
BorrowedBooks: Tracks borrowed books (FKs for Book ID and Borrower ID).
📌 4. SQL Commands Executed
Table Creation Queries
-- Table: Authors
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    author_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    author_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Table: Books
CREATE TABLE Books (
    book_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR2(150) NOT NULL,
    genre VARCHAR2(50),
    author_id NUMBER,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES Authors(author_id)
);

-- Table: Borrowers
CREATE TABLE Borrowers (
    borrower_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    borrower_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE
);

-- Table: BorrowedBooks
CREATE TABLE BorrowedBooks (
    borrow_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    borrower_id NUMBER,
    book_id NUMBER,
    borrow_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (borrower_id) REFERENCES Borrowers(borrower_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);
📌 5. Data Insertion Queries
-- Inserting into Authors
INSERT INTO Authors VALUES (1, 'George Orwell', 'United Kingdom');
INSERT INTO Authors VALUES (2, 'Harper Lee', 'United States');

-- Inserting into Books
INSERT INTO Books VALUES (101, '1984', 'Dystopian', 1);
INSERT INTO Books VALUES (102, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Fiction', 2);

-- Inserting into Borrowers
INSERT INTO Borrowers VALUES (201, 'Alice Johnson', 'alice@email.com');
INSERT INTO Borrowers VALUES (202, 'Brian Smith', 'brian@email.com');

-- Inserting into BorrowedBooks
INSERT INTO BorrowedBooks VALUES (301, 201, 101, TO_DATE('2024-03-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2024-03-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO BorrowedBooks VALUES (302, 202, 102, TO_DATE('2024-03-11', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), NULL);
📌 6. Data Retrieval Queries
Updating a Book Title
UPDATE Books SET title = 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' WHERE book_id = 101;
Deleting a Borrowed Record (Returned Book)
DELETE FROM BorrowedBooks WHERE borrow_id = 301;
Retrieving Borrowers and Their Borrowed Books
SELECT br.borrower_name, b.title, bb.borrow_date, bb.return_date
FROM BorrowedBooks bb  
JOIN Borrowers br ON bb.borrower_id = br.borrower_id  
JOIN Books b ON bb.book_id = b.book_id;
Listing All Books and Their Borrowers (if any)
SELECT b.title, br.borrower_name, bb.borrow_date  
FROM Books b  
LEFT JOIN BorrowedBooks bb ON b.book_id = bb.book_id  
LEFT JOIN Borrowers br ON bb.borrower_id = br.borrower_id;
Rollback Example
ROLLBACK;
Commit Example
COMMIT;
📌 7. Results and Analysis
This project effectively uses SQL commands to manage a Library Management System, ensuring proper handling of authors, books, borrowers, and borrowing transactions.

📌 9. Conclusion
The Library Management System database efficiently organizes book inventory, author records, borrower information, and book borrowing details. It ensures data integrity, easy retrieval, and proper tracking of borrowed books.

Future Enhancements
Automated fine calculation for overdue books.
A book reservation system.
Email notifications for due dates.
